Tired of the bell button to brake down? 
well print it yourself, and make it more original in the process 
(still hoping the children will come up with more interesting designs, 
feel free to participate into the challenge of the most exotic bell button! )


Be careful, you will need to add a sheet of something flexible and durable (i took a square of 
EPDM membrane to keep the thing watertight!

You will also need my [nohscadlib](https://github.com/nohkumado/nohscadlib.git) to compile it yourself


and here's what my actual doorbell looks like:

- model ![model](img/hinge\_switch.png = 50%)
- printed ![Doorbell photo](img/proto1\_klingelknopf.jpg = 60%)

its a prototype, i printed it with a cleareance of .4mm, which was too much... 
if you want the hinge model yourself, drop me a message for the hinge itself

have fun
